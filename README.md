## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Visitor Goals

        1. As a Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the freelancers experience.
        2. As a Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a Visitor, I want to previous work or work examples. I also want to locate their social media and GitHub links to see examples of their work.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are black and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Spectral font is used for headings and the Rubik font is used for main content throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is stark and graphic. The large headings and angular shapes are used to create a simple but striking experience.
